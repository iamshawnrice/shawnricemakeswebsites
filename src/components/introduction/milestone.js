				<p>I was working as a rental agent for a real estate broker in Brooklyn, when my boss one day decided that I could make websites. Never one to back away from a challenge, I obtained a copy of Dreamweaver and a book on HTML. Within a week we had a perfectly horrible little 4 page site on our hands. Lucky for me, he was satisfied, paid me a few hundred dollars and I was never interested in showing another apartment again. This was what those in the world of  dramatic literature refer to as the ‘Inciting Incident’.</p>
